The LLM Alpha Discovery Challenge
Leveraging Next-Gen AI for Creative Signal Generation
Quantitative finance is evolving. We are moving beyond standard technical analysis and into the era of LLM-assisted hypothesis generation. This challenge asks you to stop treating AI as just a coding assistant and start treating it as a research partner. Your goal is to use Gemini 3.0 (via Google AI Studio) to brainstorm, code, and validate novel trading signals. We are looking for creativity—unconventional logic, alternative data correlations, or novel combinations of traditional factors—that result in a mathematically robust edge.
The Mission:
Develop a trading signal or a portfolio of signals on QQQ from 2013 - 2023 (data below) that achieves a Sharpe Ratio of 0.8+ . You must use Gemini 3.0 with Code Execution Enabled to ensure that every hypothesis is immediately backtested and verified for accuracy within the chat interface.

Objectives & Metrics
Your strategy must meet the following strict performance criteria over the backtest period of 01/01/2013 through 01/01/2023:
Risk-Adjusted Return: The primary metric is a Sharpe Ratio ≥ 0.8.
You can use leverage from -1 (100% short) to +1.5X (150% Long) per day. Each trade/change of leverage must happen at the close and then be held until the next close. 
Robustness (Sensitivity Testing): You must demonstrate that your signal is not overfit. A ±10% shift in your key parameters (e.g., moving average lengths, RSI thresholds, volatility windows) should not result in a strategy collapse. If changing a 20-day lookback to an 18-day lookback destroys the alpha, the signal is rejected.
You must ensure there’s no lookahead bias. All data and signals must be calculated on information known at the time of the trade or before. For example, it would be invalid to create indicators or signals from the entire dataset and then use those indicators to make trading decisions earlier on (like Z-scores, or averages over the whole period, etc).
Creative LLM Usage: You must document how you prompted Gemini 3.0 to help derive the signal. Did you ask it to simulate a specific trader persona? Did you ask it to find inverse correlations between volatility and volume? Show your work.
The more signals or portfolios of signals you can come up with using LLM as your research partner, the better! 
Data for QQQ    (Copy it. Feel free to use daily data from other assets if you have it and want)
Example Workflow: 
Generate a Hypothesis by collaborating back and forth with Gemini
“When volatility is lower than usual, lever up on QQQ to 1.5X. When it is extremely high, go short.” 
Backtest it either in your own code or using Gemini. If you use Gemini, ensure you give it a CSV with the data and TURN ON code execution (otherwise it will hallucinate). If you have used Gemini to backtest, ensure to also check its work with your own code to ensure accuracy 
Create a library of a bunch of signals (or portfolios of signals) with Sharpe> 0.8 over the entire time period. 
Combine the signals in interesting ways to create the highest Sharpe ensemble
